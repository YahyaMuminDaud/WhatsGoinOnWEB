Welcome to WHATS GOIN ON
I create this idea because lately those around me have been complaining that there isn't much to do these days
After watching a video where a guy put posters around New York and everyone watched him eat cheeseballs I realized that I wanted to create a place where people can find those events more easily.
So that's where Whats Goin On was born. It's a passion project that'll also benefit me.
